    <h2>Banana Bread Ingredients</h2>
    <p>You likely already have all the ingredients you'll need for this banana bread recipe on hand. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong> Butter:</strong> A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
        <li><strong> Brown sugar: </strong>Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong> Bananas:</strong>Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
